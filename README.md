# Zephyr

## Description
---
    For this Project I needed to create a program that could display the weather forecast to plan trips accordingly. My weather channel allows you to easily search the name of a city from anywhere around the world. The weather conditions such as wind, humidity, temperature and UV will be displayed. Below that a five day forecast is shown. The data was grathered with a weather API and multiple fetch calls to target specific data. After that I used js to dynamically generate elements to store the fetch data in. The searches are stored in the local data and are displayed underneath the search bar. I learned how to make a much more interactive webpage that can access API data.

## Installation

To install this application go to https://github.com/Jahbeezy/Zephyr and copy the SSH key and clone it to your terminal.

## Usage

Go to https://jahbeezy.github.io/Zephyr/ and focus on the input box. Type in a city then click the search button. You will be presented with the current temperature, wind, humidity and UV reading. Below that will be a five day forecast. You can then search another city after. Searches are saved into local storage and displayed on the page.
